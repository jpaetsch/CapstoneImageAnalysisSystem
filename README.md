This system is a low-footprint versatile system involving hardware and software developments for recognition of objects and/or faces through machine learning algorithms.

### Development environment
To run the `dev` server:
1. Navigate to the project directory in terminal
2. Create a virtual environment using: `python3 -m venv env`
3. Run `source env/bin/activate`. This will start the Python virtual environment.
4. In the environment, run `python3 main.py` to run the server in the `main.py` file.
